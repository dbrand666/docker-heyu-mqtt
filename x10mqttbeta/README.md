# Home Assistant Community Add-on: X10mqtt BETA



## About

The X10 to MQTT add-on provides for X10 control when using a CM11 or CM17a serial interface connected to your Home Assistant OS system using MQTT.

Key features:

- Allows for Home Assistant OS users to control X10 devices using MQTT, since 'heyu' is not available in the Docker-based Home Assistant
- When using a CM11, monitors for external X10 commands (e.g. from an X10 remote) and updates the status in Home Assistant accordingly.
